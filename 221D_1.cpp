/*
The overall problem requires us to count how many number that has value x also exsits x times
in a specific range [l, r]. 
We realize that there will be at most sqrt(n) distinct value, hence:
- We create a cnt[value] that count the apperances of a value. If the value > cnt[value],
we'll simply discard the number. Hence, the number that we will have to build the prefixSum
will be at most O(sqrt(n)) and range from [1, n].
The complexity will be closed to n * sqrt(n) ~ 10^8, hence we should pay attention while implementing
Bad practices such as #define int long long, ... should be discarded to lower the mem req!

- For all value x that occurs at least x times in the range [1, n], we should divide them into
blocks. Blocks storing will be 2D vector: On the first dimession, we store a number that represents
a possible value (any value x >= cnt[x]). On the second dimension, we'll store the range [1, n] as 
a prefixSum of occurences.

- Therefore, the query will be handled by utilizing the prefixSum of occurences of all the possible
values that we've built.
